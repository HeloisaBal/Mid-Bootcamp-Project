# Mid-Bootcamp-Project-Helsinki
This project is a descriptive analysis of the Helsinki City Bikes system in Finland.
It includes 2 different datasets and provides insights from the data ranging from 2018 until 2020 (inclusive).

It also predicts the distance biked per user with hight accuracy by using linear regression and attemps to predict the biked day of the week using multinomial logistic regression (with no success, needs to be revised)
